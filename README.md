# Tech Due Diligence • Fractional CTO/CISO • Ex‑Navy CIO (SES)

I’m **Ramberto** – a retired Navy Captain (O6), former Navy SAP CIO (SES), and nonprofit CTO turned **independent advisor** focused on:

- **Technical & cyber due diligence** for PE/VC and strategic investors  
- **Fractional CTO/CISO support** for organizations in transition or under pressure  
- **Cloud & cybersecurity architecture** for secure, observable, large‑scale platforms  

I’ve led a 350‑engineer global organization serving 90k+ users across the Department of Defense and later modernized a major media nonprofit’s broadcast and digital stack into a cloud‑ready, data‑driven platform. My work centers on turning **complex, fragile systems into reliable, observable architectures** – and turning deep technical detail into **clear risk and investment decisions**.

## What you’ll find here

This GitHub is a **working bench**, not a polished product portfolio. Expect small, focused examples that show **how I think**, not giant monolith repos.

**You’ll primarily see:**

- **Architecture & due diligence artifacts**  
  Reference architectures, risk maps, and scoring frameworks for technical and cyber due diligence – the kinds of tools I use to help investors and operators understand where systems are fragile, scalable, or exposed.

- **Cloud & security patterns**  
  Sample configurations, Infrastructure as Code snippets, and implementation patterns for secure, observable systems on **Azure** and **AWS**, with an emphasis on **zero trust** and **defense‑grade reliability**.

- **Applied analytics / ML experiments (R & Python)**  
  Small projects using **R** and **Python** to explore predictive analytics, risk scoring, and system behavior modeling tied to real‑world technology and cyber decision problems.

Over time, I’ll keep adding **small, pragmatic examples** that are easy to read and reuse. The goal is to make it obvious how I approach architecture, risk, and modernization.

## Focus areas

- Technical and cyber **due diligence** for PE/VC and M&A  
- **Cloud architecture** (Azure, AWS) and secure distributed systems  
- **Zero trust**, DevSecOps, observability, and incident reduction  
- C4I / C5I and cyber operations in high‑threat, resource‑constrained environments  
- Data‑driven decision support: metrics, dashboards, and risk scoring  

I’m especially interested in **PE/VC‑backed platforms**, **defense and national security technology**, and **mission‑driven nonprofits** that need high‑end expertise in a constrained environment.

## How I work

My default approach:

1. **Clarify the decision**  
   What’s being decided (invest, modernize, retire, re‑platform), over what horizon, and who owns the risk?

2. **Map the system**  
   Architecture, data flows, dependencies, and failure modes – including where complexity and fragility really live.

3. **Quantify what matters**  
   Reliability, security exposure, scalability, and cost, using practical metrics and simple models that teams can actually maintain.

4. **Shape options**  
   Clear trade‑offs and sequenced roadmaps that respect constraints (team, time, budget) instead of wish‑lists.

5. **Enable the team**  
   Leave behind patterns, guardrails, and habits so the organization isn’t consultant‑dependent.

## Who this is for

If you’re:

- A **PE/VC investor** needing structured, technically credible due diligence  
- A **founder, CTO, or CISO** under pressure to stabilize or modernize a complex platform  
- A **mission‑driven nonprofit** that needs top‑tier cloud/cyber expertise at a sustainable price  

…then the artifacts and patterns here are meant to feel familiar: practical, opinionated, and execution‑oriented.
