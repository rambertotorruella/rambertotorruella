## Hi, I’m Ramberto Torruella Jr.

I’m a builder-centric CTO and former Navy CIO (SES) who focuses on secure distributed systems, cloud modernization, and data-driven platforms. I’ve led engineering organizations from submarines to streaming radio, and I care most about architectures that are both operationally credible and humane for the people who have to run them.

### What I work on

- Secure, cloud-native service architectures (Azure/AWS, zero trust, DevSecOps)
- Observability and incident reduction for complex systems
- Cyber and technology strategy for defense, national security, and nonprofits
- Teaching and writing at the intersection of technology, operations, and policy

### Selected public repos

- **Modern Secure Service Blueprint** – reference architecture for a small cloud service designed around security, observability, and operability.
- (future) **Cyber / Tech Strategy Teaching Kit** – slide decks, notes, and examples I use when teaching cyber and technology strategy.
- (future) **Complex Systems / Simulation Experiments** – small models and notebooks exploring cyber risk, operations, and decision-making under constraints.

I’m gradually making more of my teaching materials, models, and architectural experiments public here.
