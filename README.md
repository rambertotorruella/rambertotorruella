# Ex-Navy CIO (SES) | Tech Due Diligence for PE/VC | Fractional CTO/CISO | Cloud & Cybersecurity

I’m Ramberto – an ex-Navy CIO (SES), nonprofit CTO, and CISSP focused on:

- **Technical due diligence for PE/VC and strategic investors**
- **Cloud and cybersecurity architecture** for secure, large-scale platforms
- **Fractional CTO/CISO support** for organizations in transition or under pressure

I’ve led a 350‑engineer global organization serving 90k+ users across the Department of Defense, and later transformed a major media nonprofit’s broadcast and digital stack into a cloud‑ready, data‑driven platform. My work centers on turning complex, fragile systems into reliable, observable architectures – and turning technical detail into clear risk and investment decisions.

## What you’ll find here

This GitHub is a **working bench**, not a polished product portfolio. Expect:

- **Architecture & due diligence artifacts**  
  Lightweight examples of how I analyze systems: reference architectures, risk maps, and scoring frameworks for technical and cyber due diligence.

- **Cloud & security patterns**  
  Sample configurations, IaC snippets, and patterns for secure, observable systems on **Azure** and **AWS** (with an emphasis on zero trust and defense‑grade reliability).

- **Applied analytics / ML experiments (R & Python)**  
  Small projects using **R** and **Python** to explore predictive analytics, risk scoring, and system behavior modeling – often tied to real-world technology and cyber decision problems.

Over time, I’ll favor **small, pragmatic examples** over large monolith repos – the goal is to show how I think, not ship full products here.

## Focus areas

- Technical and cyber **due diligence** for PE/VC and M&A
- **Cloud architecture** (Azure, AWS) and secure distributed systems
- **Zero trust**, DevSecOps, observability, and incident reduction
- C4I / C5I and cyber operations in high‑threat, resource‑constrained environments
- Data‑driven decision support: metrics, dashboards, and risk scoring

## How I work

My default approach is:

1. **Clarify the decision** – What’s being decided (invest, modernize, retire, re‑platform), and who owns the risk?
2. **Map the system** – Architecture, data flows, dependencies, and failure modes.
3. **Quantify what matters** – Reliability, security exposure, scalability, and cost, using practical metrics and simple models.
4. **Shape options** – Clear trade‑offs and sequenced roadmaps that teams can actually execute.
5. **Enable the team** – Leave behind patterns, guardrails, and habits so the organization isn’t consultant‑dependent.

## Contact

For advisory work related to **technical due diligence, cloud and cybersecurity architecture, or fractional CTO/CISO support**, the best place to reach me is:

- **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/rambertotorruella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rambertotorruella)

I’m especially interested in **PE/VC‑backed platforms**, **defense and national security technology**, and **mission‑driven nonprofits** that need high‑end expertise in a constrained environment.
